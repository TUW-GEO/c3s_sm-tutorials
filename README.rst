This package contains the jupyter notebooks tutorials for `Satellite Soil Moisture data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store <https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.d7782f18>`_.

The package is designed to run on `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org/>`_. To open a notebook in your browser click on one of the following badges. Please note that opening the files on mybinder may take a few minutes (`it takes longer if the notebook was not used for some time <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html#performance-and-speed>`_).

Download C3S Satellite Soil Moisture data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), read data stacks in python using `xarray <xarray.pydata.org/>`_ and perform simple analyses of soil moisture anomalies over selected study areas.

**Note**: *It can take a few minutes to open notebooks on mybinder. If jupyter-lab does not open in your browser after e.g. 5-10 minutes, refresh the mybinder loading page and try again.*

Jupyter notebook controls
-------------------------
If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, there are numerous tutorials available online, e.g. `here <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/>`_ or `here <https://jupyter-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps/create-notebook.html>`_. Some cells in the notebooks depend on running previous cells first (otherwise you will see an error message). Therefore it is recommended to either run all cells directly (click ðŸž‚ðŸž‚) or running individual cells from top to bottom (â–º).

- **â–º** Run all code in a single block (cell)
- **â– ** Interrupt the kernel to stop any code execution
- **âŸ³** Restart the kernel
- **ðŸž‚ðŸž‚** Restart Kernel and run all cells
